# How it works

Before you start, choose numbers from 1 to 6. Your numbers will be shown as 001, 002, ... as codes in the game. You can play with less people, if you want to do this, just ignore extra players. But if you want to play with extra people, you can edit the code, easily, as well.

Now, run "codenames-the-game.py" to setup your game. First, it'll show you teams, few seconds later "secret board". If you follow instruction. You can easily create you own unique turns for codenames.

IRL, team captains a.k.a agent masters will jot down 25 words to cube note papers. Then arrange how it's shown as templates. Then when everyone is ready, turn will start. When turn finishes, play the "code" again and it'll create a new random turn to go on. 

**PS: For concealing cards in game; you can make 9 blue, 9 red, 7 yellow and 1 black cards as cube format.**

If you want to play online, you may use discord's screen sharing specialty for showing your screen as team captain. Creating the "secret board" you may use one of a basic "draw sketch" program such as paint or whatever you like. 

**PS: If you know how to play already, you can find new ways to play, as well. Enjoy!**
